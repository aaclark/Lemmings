"You may be small, but you have the heart of a great tree!",
"A seed planted in fertile ground is a seed with a good future!",
"Your home was once a tree, but you'll soon live underground! How does it feel?",
"Size does not matter. A tree is powerful and tall, but a seed can catch the wind and explore the world!",
"Believe in yourself and fight for what is right! All the great forests in the world were started by a seed!",
"Within you lies great potential. With the right home and proper nourishment, you will grow beyond what you could ever dream!",
"The tree you left this morning was a wonderful home, but if you stayed there forever, you'd never know what might be possible!",
"It's dangerous out here, and was safe back at your tree. But smell the air here! The forest floor is full of odors you'd never smell in the treetops!",
"You're not the biggest seed I've seen, but you're not the smallest either. Keep at it!",
"Your mistakes only make you stronger. Learn from them, and keep moving forward to the fertile soil!",
"Your deeds determine who you are. You're not the tree you came from, but you are the tree you will become!",
"Trees hold the earth together with their roots, but seeds are the future! You will strengthen another forest with your strong roots someday!",
"Find your roots and become strong before winter comes! Remember, the snow will be cold, but you'll reawaken in the spring all the stronger!",
"You have a home in front of you and a home behind you. Your tree and the soil. But only one will nourish you. Choose wisely!",
"You might miss your tree, but remember - everything changes! The leaves on your branches will fall someday too, and new ones will grow!",
"A well-watered seed on barren ground will sprout, but not take root. Choose your ground with caution and care!",
